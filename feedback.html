			<p>I like that the library is well supplied with research material and also allows students to request any additional. I also particularly love the accessibility of study materials through various e-Learning platforms that come with the degree such as O'Reilly, Kortext along with many others. These have been instrumental for me in learning new software and keeping up to date with the latest research in my field. Digitally is where Essex truly shines</p>

			<p>The university is supportive in having the resources, network and different areas of specialities available to aid individual learning and achievements. I feel very supported when faced with academical challenges. There are social activities, clubs and facilities to support physical, social and mental wellbeing as the university ensures the academic journey is successfully achieved.

I love the idea of the find my way Essex app however, its not very easy to use or understand unfortunately. I love the more modern buildings such as the stem building and abs in comparison to the ltb building. Generally, I feel as if Essex is an inclusive university that really tries to cater to all

			<p>There are cloud resources available for accessing University computers and licenced software for programming, 3D modelling with Blender, project management with Jira, version control with Gitlab. That's just the tip of the iceberg. I have found the facilities pretty incredible especially in the science labs where I was able to conduct my research into Brain Computer Interfaces with state of the art EEG equipment and testing facilities. </p>
